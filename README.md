### This is an analysis which answers a set of questions based on sales data.<br/>
## Dataset
### This dataset consists of orders and the relevant order and customer details. In this case the data was provided in an Excel document with differnt tables on different sheets of the Excel workbook. Usually data with different tables that are related by a common ID would be encountered in a database. In this case I've had to import the different tables and join them in python.<br/>
## Questions
1. What is the total number of sales?
2. What is the eaverage sales per month?
3. What is the monthly revenue?
4. What are the key demographics of the customers?
5. Which county generated the most sales on average?
6. What were the profits per product per month?
7. When were the best and worst selling periods?
## Next Steps
### Once the metrics of interest are identified, productionising the script so that these metrics can be calculated by simply changing the input data should be the next step. Then, developing the infrastructure to feed this data to a cloud-based visualisation front end will make the consumption of this information for management a much smoother process.
